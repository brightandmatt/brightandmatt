## Bright & Matt is a small product and design company

We work across digital transformations in government, non-profit and commercial with a wide range of experience in leadership, product management, user experience, interaction design, and user research

What we do:

- place high quality digital delivery teams using our trusted network of service designers, interaction designers, content designers, user researchers and product managers
- tackle strategic design and research challenges: including supporting communities of practice and setting delivery teams up to succeed
- prioritise user needs, business requirements and a project scope and roadmap, we sketch, design and code things quickly, getting stuff in front of people and giving precedence to conversations over documentation.

Collectively, weâ€™ve delivered high profile digital services across the public, private and not for profit sectors, in delivery teams and in senior leadership roles.

We create value. We work in a modern, agile, user-centred way.
